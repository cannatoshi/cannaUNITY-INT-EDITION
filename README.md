## 🛡️ § KCanG Compliant, Data Protection & Anonymization Concept

**cannaUNITY** is completely based on the zero-knowledge principle:  
There is a strict separation between personal data (local) and anonymized online data (UUID-based). The online area **never** receives access to real identities or personal data!

### Authentication & Access Control

```
[Local: Root Server]                              [Online Server]
 ┌──────────────────────────┐                     ┌────────────────────────────┐
 │ Django Backend           │                     │ Sync Database/API          │
 │ Local PostgreSQL DB      │                     │ Login/API for Mobile App   │
 │ Internal UI (Admin, Web) │                     │                            │
 └────────────┬─────────────┘                     └────────────┬──────────────┘
              │    🔄 Pull/Push via API                  🔄 Pull by App
              ▼                                           ▼
     → One-way Communication:                   [React Native App (e.g., iOS)]
     Local Cronjob sends Data →                Access **only to Online API**

Optional > Push Gateway: Local Server → Mini-API on VPS → pushes data to App API
```

- **Online Login:** Joomla/Passkey (biometric), alternatively 3-factor with PIN  
- **Facility Access (Outdoor Areas):** UniFi Access with RFID, facial recognition, optional PIN  
- **Interior Areas (e.g., Flowering Chamber):** Access exclusively via NFC/RFID, automatic time tracking  
- **Production Steps:** Track&Trace entries are made via RFID/NFC terminals with role binding

## 🔁 UUID Track & Trace: From Seed to Dispensing incl. MMS

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/trackandtrace/samen_verwaltung_aktiv.png" alt="Preview" width="1920">
</p>

Every processing step is documented and tamper-proof logged:

1. **Purchase** of seed
2. **Planting** – either as mother plant or directly as flowering plant
3. **Cutting Treatment**
4. **Growth Care**
5. **Harvest**
6. **Drying**
7. **Laboratory Control**
8. **Processing**
9. **Product Dispensing** to members (anonymized)
10. **Destruction** (optional, if necessary)

Each step is confirmed via employee accounts using RFID/NFC and documented in real-time.

- 🚦 **Unique to cannaUNITY:**  
> Thanks to Multi-Chain ForeignKey architecture, all processing paths (seeds, cuttings, mixed cultures) are completely seamlessly mapped – from packaging unit to the origin of genetics.  
> Every processing chain remains traceable even after migration, renaming, or adjustment and always references the real objects – no redundancies, no "shadow fields," no data loss.

</p>

Multimedia Support in Track&Trace Module

The Track & Trace system now supports upload and assignment of multimedia files (images and videos) to the respective work steps of individual batches. The implementation is currently productively enabled for steps 1 to 5:

✅ Step 1: Seed Purchase (SeedPurchase)
✅ Step 2: Mother Plants (MotherPlantBatch)
✅ Step 3: Flowering Plants from Seeds (FloweringPlantBatch)
✅ Step 4: Cuttings (CuttingBatch)
✅ Step 5: Flowering Plants from Cuttings (BloomingCuttingBatch)
✅ Step 6: Harvest
✅ Step 7: Drying
✅ Step 8: Processing
✅ Step 9: Laboratory Control
✅ Step 10: Packaging
✅ Step 11: Product Dispensing

✅ Additionally: Multimedia Management, Cannabis Rating & Destruction.

Files are securely stored on the backend and are only accessible within the closed association network. Additionally, server-side hooks have been prepared to optionally automatically share content in verified, private Facebook groups consisting exclusively of previously approved association members.

## 🔧 Integration & Automation

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots\controller\dashboard_simatic_g2.png" alt="Preview" width="1920">
</p>

cannaUNITY now fully relies on the latest generation of Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 G2 control technology. The previously integrated Siemens LOGO8! connection was removed due to its conceptual limitations. The LOGO series offered no structured API, no remotely configurable time switching logic, and was neither scalable nor maintainable for multi-room grow controller operation.

The SIMATIC G2, on the other hand, enables for the first time complete control of industrial processes via a modern web architecture with genuine API communication – secure, performant, redundant, and fully integrable into the cannaUNITY frontend.

🔌 Highlights of SIMATIC G2 Integration
✅ Web API with structured REST communication (HTTPS, JSON)
✅ MQTT connection with topic flexibility via LMQTT_FB
✅ Matrix 2.0 & TLS encryption, multi-session, authentication
✅ Time switching, ramp, and scene control configurable via Django
✅ UUID-based linking of each PLC to a room object
✅ Redundant autonomous operation: Rooms function even without central server
✅ Immutable audit trails - blockchain-like event chains for authority compliance

🌞 0-10V Light Control & Daylight Profiles
Via the SM1232-AQ analog output module, cannaUNITY controls all 0-10V LED grow lights energy-efficiently and dynamically – directly from the central UI. The light profiles include sunrise and sunset simulations with finely graduated dimming down to exactly 0%, which many other systems technically do not support.

Light, pH, EC, climate, and ventilation control is done via user-friendly time grids with ramp functions, configured in the cannaUNITY interface and transmitted to the PLC via API. Each room operates independently and has its own PLC – fully synchronized but autonomously functional.

With this architecture, cannaUNITY brings industrial PLC technology for the first time into a visually controllable web environment for growers – without PLC knowledge, without STEP7, without classic programming. Control is entirely via an interactive UI that captures and addresses not only light but also climate, irrigation, drying, and process cycles in real-time.

  <img src="screenshots/WaWi/sorte_liste_detail.png" alt="Preview" width="1195">
</p>

The inventory management system forms the heart of cannabis management and seamlessly connects genetics master data with operational inventory management.
Through bidirectional integration with Track & Trace and Accounting, a closed loop is created from seed purchase to harvest.
Supported Functions & Modules:

1. Genetics Database – Over 40 attributes per strain (THC/CBD, terpenes, growth)
2. Price Tier System – Flexible volume discounts with automatic calculation
3. Track & Trace Integration – Live inventory display from operational data
4. Accounting Workflow – Purchase request → Approval → Booking
5. RFID Authorization via UniFi Access – Tamper-proof documentation of all actions
6. Media Management – Multi-image support with metadata & drag & drop
7. Purchase Aggregation – Cross-batch inventory determination
8. Immutable Audit Trails – Seamless change history for compliance
9. API Interfaces – REST-based communication between systems
10. Real-Time Metrics – Available seeds, plant conversions, losses

```
Track&Trace DB → Django ORM → API Endpoint → React Component → UI Update
     ↑                                              ↓
     └──────────── User Actions ←───────────────────┘
```

Each order automatically goes through the accounting approval process, is recorded in Track & Trace as goods receipt, and immediately updates the inventory overview in the inventory management system.
The solution meets all regulatory requirements of the Consumer Cannabis Act (KCanG) and enables audit-proof documentation of the entire supply chain.

## 🧱 Production Operation – Security Concept

This section describes recommended measures for securing the cannaUNITY system when deployed on a public server or in a productive environment.

### 🔒 1. Security at Root Server & Operating System Level (Linux)

**System Hardening**
- SSH access exclusively with public key
- Disable root login
- Firewall (e.g., `ufw`) with whitelist for web & SSH
- Fail2Ban for brute-force attack protection

**Reverse Proxy**
- Use **NGINX** or **Traefik** in front of Django/React
- HTTPS via **Let's Encrypt / Certbot**
- Define CORS, HSTS, CSP headers

**Automatic Updates / Patch Management**
- `unattended-upgrades` or centralized Ansible scripts
- Monitor for known CVEs in dependencies

**Deployment & User Isolation**
- Separation of system users for services (e.g., `cannaunity-web`, `cannaunity-db`)
- Use `systemd` services with `PrivateTmp`, `ProtectSystem=strict`

### ⚙️ 2. Django: Security & API Protection

- `DEBUG = False` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` correctly set
- `SECRET_KEY` securely stored (e.g., in `.env` or Vault)
- Use **HTTPOnly & Secure Cookies** for authentication tokens
- Enable **CSRF protection**, especially for API POST endpoints
- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True`, `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True`
- **Logging & Audit Logs** for API access (e.g., with `django-auditlog`)

### 🎨 3. React/Vite: Frontend Security

- No access to `.env` variables with sensitive content in frontend
- Create build version with `vite build`, hashes active
- Check public folder for unwanted files
- Protection against XSS via controlled components & avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Enforce CSP headers via NGINX

### 🧊 4. Database Security (PostgreSQL + Encryption)

- **Disk encryption** at operating system level (`LUKS`, `dm-crypt`)
- **Enable SSL/TLS** in PostgreSQL (`ssl = on`, set up certificates)
- **Role-based access control** (no public access, least privilege)
- Use `pgcrypto` for column-based encryption of sensitive fields:

  ```sql
  SELECT pgp_sym_encrypt('0123 456789', 'my_secret_key');
  ```

- **Key Management** via HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, or custom solution
- Access logging & audit tools like [`pgAudit`](https://www.pgaudit.org/)

### 💡 Additional Recommendations

- **Backups** regular & encrypted (e.g., `borg`, `restic`)
- **Monitoring & Alerting** (e.g., UptimeRobot, Netdata, Prometheus/Grafana)
- **Zero-Trust Network Principle** (VPN, IP whitelisting, no open network)
- **Security review of all Django endpoints** before deployment

> Note: These recommendations are intentionally tailored to a productive setup on a dedicated root server. For cloud deployments (AWS, Azure, etc.), different best practices apply – including VPC isolation and IAM control structures.
